# Changelog

## v9 (2018-03-31)
- Keysanity mode added. Certain key items have been mixed up, but all teleports are available from the start of the game!
- Here are the item locations that have been shuffled in Keysanity mode:
  - Franklin badge
  - Shyness book
  - King banana
  - Key to the shack
  - Hawk eye
  - Bicycle
  - Wad of bills
  - Diamond
  - Signed banana
  - Pencil eraser
  - Key to the tower
  - Town map
  - Carrot key
  - Tendakraut - but the Tendakraut has been transformed into a Jar of Fly Honey!
- Because there is a Jar of Fly Honey in the item pool, proceeding through Winters as Jeff is not required; however, if you choose to, the Bubble Monkey rope event has been patched to work even if you have extra companions.
- Keysanity mode is incompatible with Ancient Cave mode, and probably needs a lot of testing. Let me know if you encounter issues.

- Non-essential dialogs shuffle with the 'd' flag (with special surprises possible at Pokey).
