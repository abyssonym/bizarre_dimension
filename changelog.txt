v0.1
-Praying at Giygas no longer softlocks.
-Exit Mice are now functional. They will take you back to the most recent Sanctuary Spot you visited, or home if you have not visited any.
-Sanctuary Spots are working now.
-Many items will now appear only once per dungeon, notably items that can only be equipped by one character.
-Many items that were unsellable/undroppable now can be.
-Added various protections against the enemy despawn bug.
-Ness starts with the Escargo Express phone number memorized.
-Sanctuary bosses now report their proper order.
-Some hotspots and other events have been modified, such as Poo leaving after the Pyramid.
-NPCs that start battles should never appear in the first zone.
-Various fixes to routing.

NOT FIXED
-The Lost World "geyser softlock". I'm not sure what caused this.
-Fadeouts after Hotels. This is still pretty low priority in terms of necessity vs. effort required. Use the Sound Stone to turn the lights back on.
